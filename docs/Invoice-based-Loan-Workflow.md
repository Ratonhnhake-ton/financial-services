# Invoice based Loans Workflow

The Invoice-based workflow uses the same workflow as the consent-based workflow with the difference only in the consent request. In this flow, the lender simple requests the borrower's consent to pull transaction details from their business accounts.

Secondly, the XInput form may expect other details pertaining to the borrower's business like Tax ID. Company registration address, Ownership Details etc, depending on the type of loan.
