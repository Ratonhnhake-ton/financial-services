## Introduction

The credit sector is a vital component of any economy, providing individuals and businesses with access to funds through loans, credit cards, and other financial products. This sector includes banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and other lending institutions. These entities assess borrowers' creditworthiness based on factors like income, credit history, and collateral. Interest rates charged on credit reflect the risk associated with lending and market conditions. Interest rates in the credit sector are influenced by market conditions, monetary policies, and regulatory guidelines set by the Regulatory body. The local regulatory body plays a significant role in regulating the credit sector and implementing measures to ensure its stability and healthy functioning.
